# Help_A_Stray
Please feel free to add or edit any changes in the code to make this page more productive or just email me if you guys have any ideas on how to make this idea a reality. I would seriously apprecitate any productive suggestions.
In case the css is not supporting for a mobile device I made an apk using android studio just for mobile devices. I haven't made any for apple devices as I'm still a newbie in app development, sorry!! 
Hope you guys like this idea of mine.
